### üëã Hey all!
I'm a senior at Wheaton College (IL) majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. A couple quick facts about me:
* In 3rd grade I convinced my best friend I was a robot, and I don't know if he ever found out I was lying
* The only reason I can code is because some random middle school teacher decided we should play Minecraft instead of having class (then introduced us to modding)
* In high school I played guitar and screamed for an emo band called Gangrene (can you guess how that name got picked?)
* I once reverse engineered Wheaton's outbound firewall in a bid to evade surveillance and censorship (it's less robust than you'd think)
